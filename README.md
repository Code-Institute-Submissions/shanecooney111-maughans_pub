# Maughans Pub 
## Introduction
Maughans Pub is a website about Maughans Pub, a traditional Irish Pub in Crossmolina, Co. Mayo in the west of Ireland. The website is targetted towards both potential customers and current customers of the pub. As there is no current website, it will be a useful asset for customers with common questions such as hosting events, opening hours and the location of the pub.

## Wireframe mockups
I utilised Balsamiq to produce wireframes to organise the site structure and content placement. I used the templates provided for iPad and iPhone to create a visually pleasing mobile responsive design.

* Hero image

  * Each page includes a hero image with a text overlay which further indicates to the user exactly which section of the site they are on.
  * The image was careful chosen due to the historic race car within the image along with the iconic colour scheme as a visual reminder that the Leinster Trophy race is an event with a rich and long running history. The same colour scheme as the vehicle in the image was utilised throughout the site.
